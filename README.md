1. INTRODUCTION 

Today most of people use their own vehicle for travel. While travelling most of us are troubling
with breakdown of our vehicle on the road. This is a worst experience that they have to face.
When our vehicle suddenly breakdown on the road, the user have to search for mechanic and
have to see a spare-part shops near to their location. At that time we canâ€™t able to search for a
good mechanic and we have to arrange some other transportation. By using this application the
user can find suitable mechanic. The most advantage is the user can find a mechanic based on
their user location and make payment. This application connect with google GPS
system and it shows the users current location and direct the nearest service provider to them.
There will be a HelpMe chat button that the user can use to ask some relevant questions to the mechanic. 
The application which helps to find nearby service centres as well as the fuel stations in case of any 
emergency situations like insufficient fuel on vehicles and un-avoided incidents like puncture, break failure, doping etc. With the statistics of car breakdowns growing day by day, we believe this project can be helpful to those in need.
